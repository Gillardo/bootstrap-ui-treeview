# Bootstrap-UI/treeview

AngularJs directive to show a treeview like structure of an item. Uses the bootstrap-UI collapse directive for a nice sliding animation.  This treeView has now been updated to NOT change the data in the treeView.  Some other tree view directives add different properties to the data to show the expanded/selected nodes, but this treeview will leave your data alone and uses a service to determine when a node is collapsed/selected.

[Demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/4M9AsK5eJVRI5BCkfA7h?p=preview)

## Installation
To use the directive you must have the following angular-ui bootstrap directives included already
* Collapse

You should already have the ui.bootstrap dependancy included in your app.js file like below, You then need to add ui.bootstrap.treeview, as so
```sh
angular.module('app', ['ui.bootstrap', 'ui.bootstrap.treeview']);
```
Download the source from dist/tree-view.min.js file and include it in your project.

Or use bower

```
bower install bootstrap-ui-treeview -S
```

and link with ``` bower_components/bootstrap-ui-treeview/dist/treeview.min.js ```


## Usage
You have the following properties available to use with the directive.  All are optional unless stated otherwise
* treeService (required) - Your treeService which contains the data to display
* nodeLabel - (string)
* itemClass - (string)
* itemNgInclude (string)
* emptyMessage (string)
* emptyClass (string)
 
##### nodeLabel
The name of the property that you want to display for each item
##### itemNgInclude
A string if you want to include an include for each repeated item. Each item is referenced as a node and you can reference any property within that node
##### itemClass
A string if you want to apply a css class to each item. This is needed to format items better if you use pull-right in your itemNgInclude template, you can then use pull-left on the item

Each item must have a children property, this is what will contain a further list of more items.

#### Service
The treeService has been redeveloped so that none of the treeView data is actually changed. Previously a selected and collapsed property would be added to each node of data, this is now not the case.
The service has the following properties available.

#### nodes
The data that you want to display in the treeView.  This is now required.

#### selectedNode
The node that is currently selected

#### collapsed
This is an array of all the nodes that are current collapsed

#### collapseTo (node)
Function to expand all parent nodes in a branch until the selectedNode is found

## Css
In order for you to add styles to the tree-view, each tree-view is created with a className of tree-view.  You can override any styling you want, by creating your own css.

If you would like to use a bootstrap dropdown (or another element that uses collapse class) within an item-ng-include template, the dropdown will be cut off when you are on the last element of the tree-view.  To get round this you need to apply the following css class rule (thanks jziolkow)

```sh
tree-view.collapsing.in {
    overflow: visible;
}
```


## Example
Here is an example to use the directive

####DATA - CONTROLLER
```sh
app.controller('MyController', ['TreeViewService', function(TreeViewService) {
    this.myService = new TreeViewService;
    
    myService.nodes = [
        {
            id: 1,
            name: 'first',
            children: []
        },
        {
            id: 2,
            name: 'second',
            children: [
                {
                    id: 10,
                    name: 'child of second',
                    children: [
                        {
                            id: 20,
                            name: 'grand child',
                            children: []
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ];
});
```

####HTML
```sh
<script type="text/ng-template" id="my/url/to/a/template.html">
    <div class="pull-right" style="background:yellow;color:red;padding:5px">{{ node.name }}</div>
</script>
<tree-view tree-service="ctrl.myService" node-label="name" item-class="pull-left" item-ng-include="my/url/to/a/template.html"></tree-view>
```

And you end up with a treeview like so
